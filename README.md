# Full-Stack Application

This is a full-stack application built with NestJS and Angular 17. For the components and stylings [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is used.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (version 6 or above)

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `cities` directory:

```shell
$ pwd
ottonova-cities/cities
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
$ pwd
npm install
```

3. Start the server:

```shell
$ pwd
npm run start
```

The NestJS backend will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `cities-ui` directory:

```shell
$ pwd
ottonova-cities/cities-ui
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
$ pwd
npm install
```

3. Start the server:

```shell
$ pwd
npm run start
```

The Angular 17 frontend will now be running on `http://localhost:4200`.

## Usage

You can now access the full-stack application by opening `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser. The frontend interacts with the backend API running on `http://localhost:3000`.
